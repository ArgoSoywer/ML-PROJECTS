   git clone https://github.com/A-A7med-i/ML-End-2-End
   cd 'Health Care'
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python deployment/app.py
   ```

   The app will be available at the local URL provided in the terminal.
